## Our Mission
ACBOA provides nationally recognized resources and services that enable Building Code Officials across Canada to enhance our skills and competencies to better serve communities and fulfil our role in advancing public safety in the Canadian built environment.

## Our Vision
ACBOA believes that Canadians should go about their lives, confident that the places where they live, work, and play are safe, sustainable, and accessible. Creating that reality is what professional Building Code Officials do every day – we are the “first preventers” in the Canadian built environment.

## Our Strategy
ACBOA will develop the organizational structure and operational plans to position itself as a leading national partner and driving force with an emphasis on professional-level training of Building Officials, standardized competency-based certification processes for Building Officials, and recognition of qualification equivalency for Building Codes Administration in every Province and Territory across Canada.

## Our Objectives
* Establish ACBOA as a vibrant organization to support Building Officials Associations and their members across Canada
* Establish ACBOA as a communication hub and a conduit for information related to the Building Code and stakeholders
* Establish a coordinated approach to the education and certification of Building Officials across Canada.
* Promote the profession of Building Officials in their role of advancing public safety
* Support National Codes adoption and harmonization
* Provide a national voice to communicate with government agencies and the construction industry on matters pertaining to the Building Code
