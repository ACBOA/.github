## Our Mission
ACBOA provides nationally recognized resources and services that enable Building Code Officials across Canada to enhance our skills and competencies to better serve communities and fulfil our role in advancing public safety in the Canadian built environment.

## Our Vision
ACBOA believes that Canadians should go about their lives, confident that the places where they live, work, and play are safe, sustainable, and accessible. Creating that reality is what professional Building Code Officials do every day – we are the “first preventers” in the Canadian built environment.
